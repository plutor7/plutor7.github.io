        <p>Primary is a NYC-based kids' clothing brand that makes essential, sustainable, and gender-neutral clothes in a rainbow of colors for babies and kids. As the sole Product Designer on this project, I collaborated closely with 3 teams on designing and shipping a new shopping bag feature that is now live on <a href="https://www.primary.com/">Primary.com.</a></p>

        <h2 class="mb-5 pb-1">Define the Problem</h2>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Business Goal</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">In 2023, as Primary continued to grow, the company sought ways to improve key order metrics such as UPT (Unit Per Transaction) and AOV (Average Order Value). To support this goal, the Merchandising and E-commerce teams identified an opportunity: <b>increase the visibility and sales of less popular products like hats, mittens, and socks.</b></p>

        <p class="mb-4">Since these accessories are low-cost and ideal add-ons, the strategy focused on featuring them on the Shopping Bag page, where customers review and make final changes to their orders.</p>

        <figure class="text-center mb-6">
          <img src="media/primary/quickadd/context.png" width="90%" />
          <figcaption class="text-center">Some of the low-visibility products the teams were considering promoting</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Customer Problem</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">When a customer reaches the Shopping Bag and realizes their subtotal doesn’t reach the free shipping threshold, <b>they would need to spend extra time searching for low-cost items to qualify for free shipping, or choose to abandon the order.</b></p>

        <p>In a previous survey study, we learned that 42% of our customers abandon their shopping bags because "Extra costs are too high (shipping and tax)". While we can't eliminate these costs, we can reduce friction by making low-cost, add-on products easier to find.</b></p>

        <p class="mb-4">To understand project requirement details, I connected with the SVP of eCommerce and the project manager, using the <b>5Ws + 1H framework</b> to guide my inquiries.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Research</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-4">Learn from the market</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">With the project goals and requirements in mind, I reviewed over 80 e-commerce sites and identified 10 with shopping bag features similar to what we envisioned. I summarized key findings and compiled screenshots of each example in a Google Slides deck, which was shared with key stakeholders over Slack and in project meetings.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Inspect the existing Shopping Bag performance</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Since the Shopping Bag already had two product recommendation sections—You May Also Like (YMAL) and Recently Viewed (RV), adding Quick Add risked making the page too long, especially on mobile. Market research also showed that most sites limit Shopping Bag recommendations to 2 sections. <b>To inform our decision, I collaborated with our Data Scientist to analyze YMAL and RV performance.</b></p>
        <figure class="mb-4">
          <img src="media/primary/quickadd/research-2.png" width="100%" />
        </figure>
        <p class="mb-4">We learned that both YMAL and RV contributed meaningful revenue each year. Rather than removing one of them, <b>I suggested switching from a grid to a carousel layout to improve scannability.</b> The E-commerce team took my suggestion and later we tested this idea through an A/B test. The result suggested there’s no significant difference between control and test groups in key order metrics. So we pushed this change to all users.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Feedback from Product, Engineering, and E-commerce helped answer two key questions:</p>

        <p class="mb-2">I presented the most promising options from iteration 2 to the co-founders for feedback, which helped shaping the feature:</p>
        <ul class="mx-md-5 mb-6">
          <li><b>Limit the number of products in Quick Add to 2</b> to simplify customers' decision process.</li>
          <li><b>Make sure customers don't miss Quick Add</b> so that we can collect A/B testing data in a shorter period of time.</li>

        <h3 class="mb-4">One more (unexpected) iteration</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">While the design was approved by the co-founders in January, 2024, the development work didn’t kick off until April.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">While investigating into the requirements, <b>the lead engineer identified a significant challenge: the background color of product images in the Quick Add feature differed from the regular product images.</b> This meant that new images would need to be generated and stored for each color variant of every product, introducing substantial technical complexity and potentially delaying the launch.</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><b>After weighing our options, we decided to modify the UI so that no new product images would be required.</b> I did one more design iteration maintaining the original image backgrounds and presented the updated options for approval.</p>

        <p class="mb-3">The Quick Add feature was successfully launched as an A/B test in June 2024, demonstrating a positive impact on user behavior. Key results include:</p>
        <ul class="mx-md-5">
          <li class="mb-1">Sessions with feature engagement saw a <b>10% lower cart abandonment rate.</b></li>
          <li class="mb-1"><b>17% of sessions surpassed the free-shipping threshold</b> after engaging with the feature.</li>
          <li class="mb-1">Sessions with engagement experienced a <b>17% lift in UPT and a 12% increase in conversion rate.</b></li>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Reflections</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Due to time constraints, we weren't able to conduct user testing before launch. I have suggested to conduct a post-launch usability testing to gather direct feedback from customers and understand how the feature has been impacting their shopping experience.

        <p class="mb-4">
        The technical challenges identified late in the process underscored the importance of involving engineers early in design critiques. Moving forward, I will make sure to call out changes that might require extra engineering effort in design reviews, so that we can better anticipate technical complexities and make informed trade-offs early in the process.</p>
