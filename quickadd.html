        <p>Primary is a NYC-based kids' clothing brand that makes essential, sustainable, and gender-neutral clothes in a rainbow of colors for babies and kids. As the sole Product Designer on this project, I collaborated closely with 3 teams on designing and shipping a new shopping bag feature that is now live on <a href="https://www.primary.com/">Primary.com.</a></p>

        <h2 class="mb-5 pb-1">Define the Problem</h2>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Business Goal</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">In 2023, as Primary continued to grow, the company sought ways to improve key order metrics such as UPT (Unit Per Transaction) and AOV (Average Order Value). To support this goal, the Merchandising and E-commerce teams identified an opportunity: <b>increase the visibility and sales of less popular products like hats, mittens, and socks.</b></p>

        <p class="mb-4">Since these accessories are low-cost and ideal add-ons, the strategy focused on featuring them on the Shopping Bag page, where customers review and make final changes to their orders.</p>

          <img src="media/primary/quickadd/context.png" width="90%" />
          <figcaption class="text-center">Some of the low-visibility products the teams were considering promoting</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Customer Problem</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">When a customer reaches the Shopping Bag and realizes their subtotal doesn’t reach the free shipping threshold, <b>they would need to spend extra time searching for low-cost items to qualify for free shipping, or choose to abandon the order.</b></p>

        <p>In a previous survey study, we learned that 42% of our customers abandon their shopping bags because "Extra costs are too high (shipping and tax)". While we can't eliminate these costs, we can reduce friction by making low-cost, add-on products easier to find.</b></p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Unpack the requirements</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">To understand project requirement details, I connected with the SVP of eCommerce and the project manager, using the <b>5Ws + 1H framework</b> to guide my inquiries.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Research</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-4">Learn from the market</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">With the project goals and requirements in mind, I reviewed over 80 e-commerce sites and identified 10 with shopping bag features similar to what we envisioned. I summarized key findings and compiled screenshots of each example in a Google Slides deck, which was shared with key stakeholders over Slack and in project meetings.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Inspect the existing Shopping Bag performance</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Since the Shopping Bag already had two product recommendation sections—You May Also Like (YMAL) and Recently Viewed (RV), adding Quick Add risked making the page too long, especially on mobile. The market research also indicated that most sites keep their shopping bags simple by limiting recommendation sections to two. <b>To determine whether both YMAL and RV should be kept, I collaborated with our Data Scientist to analyze their performance.</b></p>
        <figure class="mb-4">
          <img src="media/primary/quickadd/research-2.png" width="100%" />
        </figure>
        <p class="mb-4">We learned that both YMAL and RV contributed meaningful revenue each year. Rather than removing one or both of them, <b>I suggested using carousels to improve the scannability of Shopping Bag.</b> The E-commerce team took my suggestion and later we tested this idea through an A/B test. The result suggested there’s no significant difference between control and test groups in key order metrics. So we pushed this change to all users before the release of Quick Add.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1 col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-lg-6 offset-lg-3">
        <p class="mb-2">I presented the most promising options from iteration 2 to the co-founders for feedback, which helped shaping the feature:</p>
        <ul class="mx-md-5 mb-6">
          <li><b>Limit the number of products in Quick Add to 2</b> to simplify customers' decision process.</li>
          <li><b>Make sure customers don't miss Quick Add</b> so that we can collect A/B testing data in a shorter period of time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Iteration 3-4</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Based on leadership feedback, I continued refining the designs to <b>simplify and prioritize Quick Add.</b></p>

        <p class="mb-4">To create a more cohesive look, I explored using a light gray background from Primary’s style library for the Quick Add section in some design options. Since all product images already had a gray background, I adjusted their background color to white to ensure clear differentiation within the section. The feasibility of implementing this background adjustment was confirmed by Engineering and the Digital Asset Manager.

        <h3 class="mb-4">One more (unexpected) iteration</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">During the implementation phase, the lead engineer identified a significant challenge with adjusting product images: storing and fetching a separate set of images for Quick Add products would introduce substantial technical complexity and potentially delay the launch.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">To address this, <b>we evaluated our options and decided to modify the UI to avoid the need for new product images.</b> I iterated on the design, maintaining the original image backgrounds, and presented the updated options for approval.</p>

        <p class="mb-3">The Quick Add feature was successfully launched as an A/B test in June 2024, demonstrating a positive impact on user behavior. Key results include:</p>
        <ul class="mx-md-5">
          <li class="mb-1">Sessions that engaged with the feature had a <b>10% ↓ in cart abandonment rate.</b></li>
          <li class="mb-1">Sessions with engagement had a <b>17% ↑ in UPT.</b></li>
          <li class="mb-1"><b>17% of sessions passed the free-shipping threshold</b> after adding products from Quick Add to bag.</li>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Reflections</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">In this project, <b>I became more skilled at navigating unexpected constraints and pivot quickly.</b> I learned to maintain focus on delivering effective solutions instead of the stress itself.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Due to time constraints, we couldn't validate our assumptions before launch.<b> I would like to gather insights from users and understand how this feature have been perceived and used.</b> I have suggested to the team to conduct a post-launch usability testing when bandwidth allows.</p>

        <p><b>The key to successful product recommendations is making the suggestions relevant to the customer.</b> If we could leverage the customer's order history or browsing behavior, we can personalize Quick Add suggestions and make the feature more impactful.</p>
