      <h1 class="mb-6">2020 in retrospect</h1>

      <p class="mb-6">What a year. We all had no idea of what we are walking into on Jan 1st, 2020, and here we are. Allow me to take a moment to cherish my new experiences, reflect on my new learnings, and mourn my loss.</p>
      
      <h2 class="mb-4">Things I achieved:</h2>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Translated a book (English to Chinese)</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">Yes! And, I did not know I can do this before I did it. I am so lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to a larger purpose as a novice translator.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">This book, People Powered by Jono Bacon, talks about how to build communities for different types of businesses and how to harness the power of communities for organizations. I became interested in this book because I had noticed from past years that the rising power of communities has benefited countless individuals in so many different ways. The content platforms, like Instagram, Pinterest, Zhihu, are changing the way people look at the world and how to respond to it. But I’ve never given much thought to what communities could mean to the people who own or manage them. How do we help the growth of these communities so they can be of use to a larger audience and further benefit the business, and let the mutual enhancement bring a larger influence on the world? This book gave me something new to think about, and it provided some pragmatic approaches to the solution.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">It took me 3 months, around 4 hours each week for the whole translation work. I partnered with 2 other translators -- Yunnuo Cheng and a Zhihan Gao -- on the op. Each week we translate about 10 pages individually, review translations from each other, and discuss them in a 2-hour-long weekly meeting. It has been a pleasure working with these two girls, and I enjoyed the whole process of translating and talking about our decision process. It was fun to learn how another person would approach the same problem and calibrate our languages so the whole book reads like work from one person, not three.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">The book is going to be published this year, hopefully before September. I hope people find it helpful and fun to read.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Gave a speech in design</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">I thought I wouldn’t love giving virtual public presentations, but I was wrong. In October 2020, I gave a speech on what it is like working as a product designer in the U.S. to the UXRen community. It was a joint speech with Haitong, Wang, who was a UX researcher from Google in the bay area.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">For a long time, I had the impression of “you have to be really successful and famous to give a speech that matters” but I was totally wrong. It really depends on who your audience is and how well you can tell your stories. Sometimes you may feel the story you are about to tell is nothing special, but it could MEAN SOMETHING to others. Figuring out what those elements are is a great part of constructing a good speech.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">I also got a chance to build confidence in public speaking from this opportunity. I was talking to Chinese audiences, so I spoke in my mother tongue. I hope next time I can give a speech in English.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Shipped a new feature</h3>

      <p class="mb-6">I was thrilled that I shipped the first large feature in my life! It is the size filters on <a href="https://www.primary.com">Primary.com</a>, a long-awaited feature requested by a lot of customers. I partnered with two excellent engineers on this project, and our customers LOVE it! Nothing's more satisfying than creating something that people would frequently use and enjoy.</p>


      <h3 class="mb-3">Built more muscles</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">I had a chance to try rock climbing in February, right before the lockdown. And I would say I love it (although I returned home with a bleeding elbow and bruises around the body)! I had to leave the gym because my arms were trembling and totally wasted. It made me realize how weak my upper body is, and I made up my mind to upgrade my muscles in the arms and back that night.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">I started doing workouts targeting the upper body, went from not able to complete a push-up on the knees to be able to do 10 standard push-ups in a row, and obtained the six-pack (or maybe four) in the process. It felt so good! I'm very proud of myself for keeping working on it and didn’t give it up.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Moved, 3 times</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">That’s not really an "achievement" because I also used to move a lot. But I wanted to mention it because I did the last 2 moves all by myself (and the last one when I was sick).</p>

      <ol class="mb-6">
        <li>I can drive 8 hours with only a 15-min break in the middle </li>
        <li>Don’t drive when you have a fever if you don’t have to </li>
        <li>Don’t listen to serious audiobooks if you’re going for a long-distance drive </li>
        <li>Maybe Google how to unlock the fuel tank door of the rental car before you get on the road </li>
        <li>The weight center of an SUV is much higher than a sedan and a sharp turn is dangerous</li>
        <li>Assembling large furniture is so fun. It's a great exercise for both mind and body and you should at least try it if you haven't</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Fought COVID</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">It felt terrible. I showed signs of cold 2 days before I moved back to NYC and I wasn’t sure I was in a good shape on the day I moved. 3 days after I moved into my new apartment I completely lost my sense of taste and smell. Then I figured I might have COVID. So I tramped to a testing point and got a test. The test result came back 5 days later and it read positive. </p>

      <p class="mb-4">Luckily, I had some medicine my parents mailed to me back in February that reportedly has cured some Covid patients in China and I had plenty of sleep and food and I am at a young age. I think doing mild workouts also helped. I still have no idea how I got it, though. I was 200% cautious the whole time.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Anyway, it's something you'll never want yourself or anyone you love to get into. Just be mindful and stay safe.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-5">Things I acquired:</h2>

      <h3 class="mb-3">New lifestyle</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">The pandemic has brought a rare opportunity for me to slow down and gaze at my life. I didn't put too much thought into lifestyles before this year. And having more time solely to myself allows me to rethink what kind of person I am and how I can plan my daily life consciously to serve my long-term goals.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">I knew that I am an artsy soul, and I am always curious about the world, the people, and the unknown. I just knew that I am a truly Minimalist, and doing/owning only things that really matter to me makes me happy. I abandoned some habits that were against the belief, like buying more foods than I need, spending money on clothes that don't fit, and getting into awkward conversations/networking events and being too nice to say no to people. I also experimented with new diets, renewed my closet,  adjusted my bedtime, and cultivated new hobbies to help my body and mind work more cohesively. It's working great so far, and I hope I can take what I've learned with me into the upcoming decades.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Financial management</h3>

      <p class="mb-6">I’ve been tracking my budget for 3 years but never thought about how to manage my money. After having some long chats with some of my older friends, I decided to dip my toes into the stock market and (seriously) plan on getting some passive income. I never think of money as something I’d chase for, nor am I interested in getting luxury houses or yachts. But having some extra dollars to spare on traveling and learning would be nice.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Self-acceptance</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">I also realized I have been too strict with myself sometimes. I used to rely on numbers to judge my well-being, and even putting on 2 lbs would make me feel guilty. I also cared too much about the other one's feelings that I tend to hide my real personality in a relationship.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Actually, none of that matters. What really matters is how "I" feel and what I should do in response to that feeling. This way of thinking is going to take a long time for me to adjust to, but I believe it will be worth it.</p>


      <h2 class="mb-5">Things I lost:</h2>

      <h3 class="mb-3">My beloved grandpa</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">There are so many words I haven't had a chance to tell my grandpa in person, so many things I wish we had a chance to do together, and so much knowledge he hadn't passed on to me. We were very close when I was in elementary school, and although we seemed to spend less time with each other as I travel further and further, deep down I know his love for me has not decreased by even one micronewton. So is mine.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">My best wishes are with him, my dearest grandpa.</p>
