      <h1 class="mb-5 header-2">From Chemistry to UX Design: what a science background has brought me</h1>
      
      <p class="mb-4">This is a topic I've been considering talking about for a long time. I have a very mixed background -- 4 years studying Applied Chemistry, 3 years in Psychology, and 2 years in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) before I landed my first job as a UX designer. I had a really difficult time figuring out how my background in science could help me in design, or maybe conversely -- help me become an awful designer. And I barely hear anyone quit their academic path to become a designer.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">After years of this lonely journey, I finally am able to speak to how my science background has impacted me as a designer. I hope this article could be helpful to those who also switched their playground from pure science to UX design.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">The eternal curiosity</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The most valuable gift I carried away from studying science is the boundless curiosity. I soon found myself becoming enthusiastic in learning design-related stuff like programming, ergonomics, human cognition, marketing, etc. and keeping curious in understanding how the world works and how we can make it better. Being curious about a wide spectrum of things helps me staying open-minded, focusing on facts and reasonings instead of my feelings when taking feedback, and feeling more closely tied with the society and nature that I shall contribute to. And I believe all these subproducts came along with curiosity are essential attributes to being a well-rounded UX designer.

      <p class="mb-6">The curiosity also drives me to become someone who's willing to take adventures and go beyond myself. It asks me to explore freely on the path to truth. When encountering failures, the only thing I care about is why it happened and how I can fix it. And when receiving praises and applauses, I can quickly calm down and clue out the things that might contribute to more repeatable results.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">The process & methodology</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Science students are trained to observe keenly, ask good questions, think about whys, come up with hypotheses and use experiments to test their ideas which later will either be proved right and investigated deeper or be thrown into another loop of inquiry. That sounds familiar, right? The tools and methods we use to study a substance, a human subject, or a group of users are very different, but the processes are of no big difference.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">It is also true when it comes to research methodologies. Before using A/B tests you might not know how it works in detail, but you must have done a lot of controlled experiments and know exactly what you should and shouldn't do when designing such experiments. I sometimes feel my "design career" can be traced back to when I worked as an experiment assistant in the cognition lab, where we used different versions of reading materials to test whether providing an illustration at certain places could help improve the reader's memory retention (yes I'm intentionally keeping two more years of design experience off resume).</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">Be precise, be serious</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">You can't be too serious and cautious about the things you do when working as a scientist. It is especially true when you work in a lab and the things you play with are dangerous or even fatal. Things can't go wrong or your life will go wrong.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">After 7 years, I still remember it was an Organic Chemistry laboratory class when one of my classmates screamed out when cleaning her tube by the sink. A drop of sulfuric acid splashed into her hair accidentally because she forgot there was acid left in the tube, and she had the tube opening facing her head when she turned on the faucet. Luckily our tutor helped her in time, so she only lost some hair and a thumbnail of scalp skin. Things like this may happen every day to scientific experiment practitioners, and it makes us more aware of our work and ourselves. We were educated to take things seriously, and I'm finding the cautiousness extended to my design work. Science students can take the word "detail-oriented" as demanded in most designer job posts to a new level. Promised.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">But I have to say there's the other side of the coin: the tendency of taking things seriously may make people feel I'm tedious or insensitive. Sometimes I need to switch my mind to another mode to respond to other people when finishing analyzing their question and organizing my thoughts in the "thinking mode" in order to not sound like a robot. It may not be true for other science-to-design switchers, but I did notice this switching happening when talking with people outside the science field and I thought it was very interesting. Some people may be not used to extract information from academic style messages (like my mom, sorry mom), so noticing this, I would pay attention to the communication styles different people prefer and adjust accordingly to make efficient conversations.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">Self-confidence</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Having confidence in yourself and the things you're doing is so important no matter what field you work in. But I had a lot of doubts and concerns when I just started learning HCI. I had no idea if I could graduate from the program with a good-looking transcript in 2 years, and if I can, can I become a good UX designer after graduation? How am I going to compete with those who have years of design experience over me after I turn a fresh graduate? I honestly had no clue at the time. But just because there were so many uncertainties, I had to drop them off my head and go blankly and bluntly. I thought to myself: I was a novice, so it is totally okay to make silly mistakes. As long as I keep learning, I can grow fast without worrying about hitting the bottleneck for some time. This mindset shift helped a lot during my master's study, and it is still helping me when I face new challenges.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">I also had another perspective to think about my unique background: I've proved myself a successful student on other tracks, so I can do this too! This can-do attitude is my best company whenever I hit hard on challenges at work. And I believe this self-confidence will be my most valuable asset in my life journey.</p> 

      <p class="mb-6">Anyway, if you ever worried about not having enough design trainings compared to your design fellows and you thought your science background isn't contributing much to your design career, that's not true. Design is such a broad realm, and it is large enough for you, who has such a unique background, to find your foothold and thrive. Just acknowledge who your uniqueness, stay hungry and humble, and go for it. <br /><br />

      The best is yet to come.</p>
