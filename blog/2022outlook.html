      <h1 class="header-2 mb-5">How could I make 2022 better?</h1>

      <p class="mb-5">It's the time of the year to take a break, look back, and see how well (or terribly) the plan made at the same time last year has been executed. This year I want to try using a structure similar to what I use at work for writing performance reviews for coworkers. I'm hoping this format could help me focus on my priorities and achieve more goals in 2022.</p>
      
      <h2 class="header-3 mb-4">Things I should do more</h2>

      <h3 class="header-4 mb-3">Reading and taking notes</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">I make reading lists at the beginning of every year since 2018. But unfortunately, I've never completed my ambitious goals for reading in any of the past years. The main reason has to be a lack of motivation. I used to think finishing reading a book is a nice-to-have thing instead of something that has to be done. This way of thinking is not helpful when you have goals to achieve. I also kept adding new books to the list, and the speed at which I discover them is way faster than the speed at which I finish reading a book. I might also have spent more time listening to podcasts and audiobooks than reading books. This explains why I didn't finish as many art/design books as I was planning to.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The good thing is, I made it a habit to take notes while reading. I found the highlights and excerpts I made extremely helpful when looking back.</p>

      <p class="mb-3">Realizing the reasons my previous reading habit didn't work, I decided to make a few changes:</p>

      <ol class="mb-6">
        <li class="mb-3">Limit the number of books on the reading list for the year.<br />
        If I discover a book that I really want to finish this year, I will remove another book from the reading list and put it back in the backlog.</li>
        <li class="mb-3">Choose book format thoughtfully.<br /> 
        I already knew that audiobooks work better for my schedule, so if it's not visual heavy or something I want to take notes for, I would search for its audiobook first.</li>
        <li class="mb-3">Spend 45 minutes reading every day.<br />
        If I had to skip one day, I should make up for it the next day.</li>
        <li class="mb-3">Share notes weekly on social media.<br />
        Getting things out there and knowing people are watching me can be motivating. At the same time, I hope the information I share could inspire some people.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Studying!</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">Learning new knowledge and acquiring new skills have always been my constant sources of happiness. Last year I finished a course in React on Codecademy, picked up chess again after over a decade, got an 8.5 on IELTS, started bouldering, tried a couple of new recipes, and started studying for a master's degree in consumer behavior and decision science. Although my original study plan was not perfectly followed through, I'm happy with what I've achieved this year.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">In 2022, I anticipate that the graduate coursework will take up a substantial amount of time. But outside of that, I am looking to hone my animation skills (it was one of my goals for 2021), get familiar with my newly acquired recording gears, and resume climbing when things get better.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Taking care of my body</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">I was proud of myself for having taken good care of my body last year. I achieved my goal of being able to do 15 standard pushups in a row, and am feeling the same HIIT workout exercise is easier compared to 12 months ago. I started cooking twice a week, experimented with the KETO diet, and learned it's not for me. Now I'm back to my eat-whatever-feels-right diet and it seems to be working well. With the help of my oral surgeon, I was finally able to wave goodbye to my four impacted wisdom teeth. It's been a productive year.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">I will be sticking to the same diet and workout schedule in 2022. One of my fitness goals for the year is to become confident at V3 in bouldering.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Living minimally</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">During the pandemic, I was exposed to the idea of minimalism as a lifestyle. I first encountered the idea as I was thinking about upgrading my wardrobe in the summer of 2020, at which time I realized I had too many pieces in my wardrobe that are either too loose or too tight or are made of fabrics that look cheap or are not comfortable to wear. So I started searching how others build their wardrobes. "Capsule wardrobe" is a keyword that I saw very often, and "minimalist style" is another. I learned that if you build your wardrobe with thoughtful planning, you can own just 50 pieces of clothing and still look amazing every day on different occasions. </p>

      <p class="mb-6">The same idea can be extended to other areas of life as well, like home styling and food planning. In my opinion, the philosophy of minimalism is something anyone who lives in this world of consumerism should give some thought to.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">Things I should stop doing</h2>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Procrastinating</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">There could be a million reasons <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/">why people procrastinate</a>, but one thing for sure is that nobody enjoys procrastinating. I myself have been having this problem since elementary school, and it seems to be getting better as I grow up. But still, it's difficult to talk myself into going to bed before 11:30 pm although I know it'll be good for my health.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I haven't beat procrastinating, but I've found a formula that helps prevent it from happening: jump right into the task before thinking/feeling too much. Most of the time procrastination happens when I think "I'll do this later" or feel "it isn't something I feel like doing now" after realizing something needs to be done. But if I cut my chain of thought immediately after "I should do this", and just get started on the thing I should finish, then there would be no room for procrastination to sneak in.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Let's take going to bed early as an example: it's 9:21 pm and you are in the middle of watching a movie. You thought "Oh I should go to bed at 11:30 pm". In the next step, you should begin to prepare for getting to bed early. This might mean finishing the movie at 10:00 pm, doing a 30-minute workout, taking a shower, and reading a couple of pages of the book you like in bed, then turning off the light at 11:30 pm and closing your eyes. It's also critical that once you get started, don't stop anywhere in the process of working towards your end goal.</p>

       <p class="mb-6">This little trick might not work for everyone but it works well for me. I hope this year I can slowly get rid of procrastinating and more things done :)</p>

       <h3 class="mb-3">Spending too much time on the phone</h3>

      <p class="mb-6">I like observing people, and I also have been observing myself. I noticed that I have been spending more and more on my phone, either swiping through social media content or watching videos that don't necessarily make my life better. None of the most important things happened on my phone in the past and it can't make me happier in the long term. So I am gradually quitting using my phone as a filler in my free time. And I am trying to avoid checking notifications every 1 hour or so (sorry, friends). I believe doing so would help me focus on what really matters and get more things done within the limited lifespan.</p>
