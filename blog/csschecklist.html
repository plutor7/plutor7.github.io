        <h1 class="mb-6">My checklist for the CSS code-not-working situation</h1>
        <img class="mb-6" src="../media/blog/css.png" width="90%" style="border-radius: 6px;">
        <p class="mb-4">I've been messing up with HTML, CSS, <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/getting-started">Liquid</a>, and Bootstrap a lot recently and I summed up this why-my-CSS-is-not-working list for myself (and for anyone who ever reached this page):</p>

        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>Typo</li>
          <li>Wrong keyword/class name</li>
          <li>Open div</li>
          <li>Wrong math</li>
          <li>Wrong file/page</li>
          <li>Browser support</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-6">More detailed explanations about the list:</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 header-3">Typo</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">This takes up about 80% of the cases. And it usually happens during midnight or around 3:52 pm and I don't know why ðŸ™‚</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 header-3">Wrong keyword/class name</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">This happens a lot when I work on different projects in the same day. So at Primary, we have our own styleguide in which every class starts with a "pw-" prefix, but the grid system I'm using for my website doesn't have that. So during the past few weeks when I worked on refreshing my portfolio after work, typing in "pw-" in my text editor felt such a natural thing for muscles when my brain's laying back. A piece of advice would be: trying refreshing your mind before switching to another project.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 header-3">Open div</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">You know what I mean.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 header-3">Wrong math</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">I once thought 2+5+6=12 and I believed the third div just didn't like the two divs before it. My bad!</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 header-3">Wrong file/page</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">When you have multiple tabs open and you constantly switch between them the chance of editing a wrong file increases. And sometimes you believe the code should be working but after several refreshes the position of the block still remains the same...that could be you refreshing the wrong page. Try not to have too many tabs open at the same time. I really wish I could "lock" a tab like I lock a layer in Figma. That would make my life much easier.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 header-3">Browser support</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">This rarely happens for me but when playing with CSS animation you might want to make sure if your browser/targeted browsers support the property. A reference I really love is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">MDN web docs by Mozilla</a>. If you go check on each property page, then at the bottom of each page you'll see a Browser compatibility chart that lists which browsers (desktop and mobile) support the property. It's pretty visualized and you can even find more detailed specifications that may need extra effort to find elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Final words: Make use of the inspector wisely, take a break when anxiety occurs.</p>
        <p class="mb-6 pb-6">Happy CSS-ing!</p>
